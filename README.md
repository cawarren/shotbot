Script to help identify and mobilize political action related to gun violence.

The script will:
- Fetch a list of yesterday's incidents relating to gun violence (incl. city/state and link to source), 
- Find the geolocation of each of the incidents (lat/long), 
- Identify which state and national legislators represent the area of the incident,
- Get their contact info (email addresses for state representatives, plus Facebook and Twitter info for national legislators), 
- Get campaign contributions made to each representative (national only) from the 'Gun Rights' industry
